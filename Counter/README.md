# React + Vite

# Through this project,I got clarity of :
## Need of Hooks
## Learnt use of useState() Hooks
## useSate() function is to propagate changes/updation over UI.
## How useState() return into array of two variables
## 0th index : variable such as count
## 1st index : method such as setCount,this method will control count variable
## to use usestate() ,define it  :
## import {useState} from 'react'
